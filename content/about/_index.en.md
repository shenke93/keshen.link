### Introduction

I've been writing blogs since secondary school. My first blogging platform was [QZone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qzone) until 2015, which had a strong connection with my [QQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent_QQ) (a popular Chinese social network) profile and most of the early readers were friends and relatives. I moved to [Douban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douban) after I studied abroad, but the inconvenient in-logging and article-publishing process depressed me somehow, thus was motivated to build my own personal website. All new blogs will be transferred to this site, despite Douban has such a nice social networking service that I will continue to use for reviewing films, books and diving in interest groups.

A preview version of this site was created at the second half of 2023, deployed on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and powered by [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). The aim was to demonstrate skills acquired from previous education experience in computer science, considering that making a personal website wouldn't be that difficult (but I am lazy). However, that preview version had several main disadvantages. The site had no domain name thus looked 'unprofessional'. The functionalities of Github Pages were very limited compared to the powerful Cloudflare (even with the free plan), making it impossible for future scaling. The blogging experience could not satisfy the content-focusing workflow and did not support full automation. In the meantime, I was quite busy looking for a job and making preparations, not able to put much effort on the website.

I decided to rebuild this website by the end of 2024 to stimulate (or maintain) my reading and writing ability (though would never be possible to catch up with the AI) by keeping on blogging. Moreover, this scope of this site would be expanded over purely professional or technical articles. For sure, it would be a creative site with a lot of fun.

Wait, should not the 'about' page contain a huge part of personal introduction? However, I am such a deeply introverted person being too afraid of self-introducing that can not add one section here for such purpose. For more information about myself, [TLDR]({{< ref "/about/_index.en.md#tldr" >}}) has been enough. If you really want to know more, then I ask you — why is your head so pointy?
